Yo, just for future reference, we are going to use the python virtual enviorment to keep things clean and easy.

To start the db (database) update progress, we need to run a few commands and this is assuming we havent set the FLASK_APP variable yet.

In the same directory as the run.py (or in some cases app.py) run the following command:
    export FLASK_APP=run.py

This is shouldnt need to be done more than once (aka during the first db setup)

Then assuming this is a first setup, run:
    flask db init
        ^this adds a migrations folder to the current directory
Then run these commands:
    flask db migrate
        As per the docs: "Alembic is currently unable to detect table name changes, column name changes, or anonymously named constraints."
        So we will basically need to dump all the tables and restart if it falls under the above constraints.

    flask db upgrade


If we dont meet any of the constraints next time then all we need to do is just run the migrate and upgrade cmds
