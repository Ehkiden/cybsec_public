    <h5>DMCA | Add</h5>
    <p>Adding an IP/MAC to the DMCA database is extremely easy. Please follow these steps to alleviate your headache:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Retrieve the <em>public</em> IP address listed within the DMCA complaint and take note of the highlighted fields.<br>Example:<br><pre>    - ------------- Infringement Details ----------------------------------
    Title:        Joker
    Timestamp:    <em style="color: red;">2019-10-21T04:12:48Z</em>

    - ---------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre></li>
        <li><h3>If an IP address has already been blocked AND is torrenting the same title, do not send a request to block again</h3></li>
        <li>Take note of the timestamp also listed within the email</li>
        <li>With this information, navigate into Splunk and go to <a href="https://<ten_id>.splunkcloud.com/en-US/app/ITS-security/dmca_wip">DMCA & VPN ID</a></li>
        <li>Change the timestamp to the <strong>day</strong> of the infringement<br><small>Note: The timestamp in the email will be listed in UTC. Translate accordingly.</small></li>
        <li>Scroll down to the widget: <em>Search by Translated IP and Port on Palo Alto</em></li>
        <li>Copy the public IP address from the email into the <em>Outside NAT</em> space and hit enter</li>
        <br>
        <li>Wait for results to populate and filter by the <em>src</em> header within the table</li>
            <ol>
                <li>If only one IP is listed, great. Go to the next step</li>
                <li>If not, take the port number from the email and paste into the <em>Port</em> space</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If one IP is listed in this search, look at the timestamp and verify it matches (within reason) with the timestamp in the DMCA complaint</li>
                        <li>If more than one IP is listed still, mark the complaint as inconclusive and close the ticket. You're done.</li>
                    </ol>
            </ol>
        <li>This is where it can get tricky. Follow these steps:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>If the IP address begins with <strong>10.20, 10.21, 10.45, 10.46, or 10.47</strong>, you can retrieve the MAC address</li>
                <li>If the IP address begins with <strong>10.31, 10.163, 10.164, 172.16-172.25, 10.112, 10.113</strong>, you can <em>NOT</em> retrieve the MAC address</li>
            </ol>
        <br>
        <li>If you <em>CAN</em> get the MAC, scroll up to the widget: <em>List of MAC addresses</em></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Copy the <em>internal</em> address from the <em>src</em> header in the table into the <em>Client IP</em> space</li>
                <li>Filter the MAC addresses listed to ensure only <em>ONE</em> unique MAC is listed within the time period</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If one MAC is listed, you now know all the required information to proceed with the block. You're done.</li>
                        <li>If not, cater the search time period in Splunk <em>closer to the timestamp listed in the email</em></li>
                    </ol>
                <li>After this step, you now know all the required information to proceed with the block. You're done.</li>
            </ol>
        <li>If you <em>CAN'T</em> get the MAC, enter in all the fields on the add page <em>EXCEPT</em> MAC address and WLC description/password and tell someone on the team. You're done.</li>
    </ol>
